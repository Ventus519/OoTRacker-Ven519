This program is meant to be use in combination ith a randomized seed for the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D Randomizer.
This program takes into account the logic used in the randomizer for the "glitchless" logic setting.
This program can be used to select obtain items at any point in the randomizer. The program will also show if a specific dungeon is completable given the items obtained. NOTE: THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT COME WITH A TIMER, use other programs for that purpose. 
This program does not utilize a map tracker.
To select an item, click on it. It will appear colored. For upgrades, you can left click again. EX: to make the program show "longshot", you can left click the hookshot icon twice.
Some items display multiple items compacted in one area. For example, the hover and iron boots have been condensed into one "boots" icon. To select one type of boots, you can use either left click (for iron boots) or right click (for hover boots). If you have both, be sure to do both actions so the program can properly take logic into account.
This tracker does not check for small keys or boss keys.
